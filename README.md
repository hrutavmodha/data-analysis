# 📊 Data Analysis with Python

- This repository contains IPython notebooks covering the essentials of data analysis using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

---

# ⚙️ Environment Setup

- It's recommended to create an isolated environment using Anaconda.

## Step 1: Create Environment

```Bash
conda create -n data-analysis python=3.11 -y
```

## Step 2: Activate Environment
```Bash
conda activate data-analysis
```

## Step 3: Install Required Packages

```
conda install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter -y
```

## 📓 Running Jupyter Notebooks

### Option 1: From Terminal

```Bash
jupyter notebook
```

- It will open your browser at http://localhost:8888/tree.
  
- Navigate to the desired .ipynb file and start running!

### Option 2: With VSCode

1. Install the Python and Jupyter extensions in VSCode.


2. Open any `.ipynb` file directly.


3. VSCode will prompt you to select an interpreter — choose the `conda` environment.
