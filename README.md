# 📊 Data Analysis with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Welcome to my hands-on repository for Data Analysis using Python.  
This project contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) showcasing practical usage of popular data analysis libraries — **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** — with real examples and clean code.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- 🔢 **NumPy**
  - Array creation and manipulation
  - Broadcasting, indexing, slicing
  - Views vs Copies

- 🐼 **Pandas**
  - Series and DataFrame basics
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - GroupBy, Merging, Filtering

- 📈 **Matplotlib**
  - Line plots, Bar plots, Histograms
  - Custom styling and annotations

**Note:** Please note that currently, there is only a notebook for NumPy. For Pandas, Matplotlib, will be added progressively so soon

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and run notebooks using Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrutavmodha/data-analysis.git
cd data-analysis
jupyter notebook
```
